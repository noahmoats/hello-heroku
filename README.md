# hello-heroku

User Story 
As a user of your hello-heroku app I want to be able to see your page.

If you want to use this app online,  you can do so by using heroku or this cool link *https://nmoats.herokuapp.com/*

So That you don't have to (a) go to my REPO, (b) download code (c) unzip (d) vsCode project (e) install node.js & express.js (f) etc.

If this does not work therer is also link in the about tab of my repo
